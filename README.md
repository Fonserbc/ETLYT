ETYLT - Every Time You Lose Time 
=====

Wiideojuegos 2012 winner!
Trailer here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8ej1xvH-2I


We did this game in 1-2 months (and mainly in the last week) so the code is probably going to be dirty :P

No plans on working on it for now.

About
===

ETYLT is intended to be played with either a *wiimote* or *wiimote + nunchuck*.
Up to 4 players can battle on a 2D arena and use their habilites and powerups to battle for their time.
Each player can change anytime the direction of the gravity as well as the rotation of the arena.
Time is the health points of each player. One can gain hp by collecting the time clocks that appear on the scenario and will lose 1 hp every second and when hit by other players.
During the play some powerups may appear on the arena that grant the player who collects them special habilities such as protective shield or super jumps.

If you would like an executable just contact me, either way the Unity project is complete here, so you should be able to just run it.


PD: The name of the repo is a typo, yes.
